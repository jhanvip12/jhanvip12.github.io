<div> <p style=color:#FFC8DA> Thank you for always doing everything you can for me, and then some. You have always showered me with so much love, affection, and care. I attribute all of my successes in life in part to your hard work and dedication into raising me. You have brought me up into a loving and successful young woman. I have learned so much from you, and I will always look up to you as someone to model after. I love you Mommy </p> </div>
